Great question ‚Äî both the **Python** and **C++** versions solve the *Car Pooling* problem using the **difference array (prefix sum)** technique. Let me break it down step by step.

---

## üîë Core Idea

Each trip `[p, start, end]` means:

* `p` people get in at `start`
* `p` people get out at `end`

So instead of simulating each passenger at every stop, we just:

1. **Increment at the start** (more people in the car).
2. **Decrement at the end** (people leave the car).
3. Then scan stops in order, computing how many passengers are in the car at each point (via prefix sum).

If at any stop the passengers exceed capacity ‚Üí return `False`.

---

## üêç Python Version

```python
def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
    x = [0]*1001  # 1001 stops (0..1000)

    # 1. Mark increments and decrements
    for [p, x1, x2] in trips:
        x[x1] += p     # passengers get in
        x[x2] -= p     # passengers get out

    maxp = 0
    # 2. Build prefix sum (running passenger count)
    for i in range(0, 1001):
        x[i] += x[i-1]     # accumulate
        maxp = max(maxp, x[i])

    # 3. Check capacity
    return maxp <= capacity
```

### Walkthrough

Trips: `[[2,1,5],[3,3,7]]`, `capacity=4`

1. `x[1]+=2, x[5]-=2`, `x[3]+=3, x[7]-=3`
2. Running totals:

   * stop1=2, stop2=2, stop3=5 (oops > 4), stop5 back to 3, stop7=0
3. Max seen = 5 ‚Üí exceeds capacity ‚Üí return `False`.

---

## üíª C++ Version

```cpp
bool carPooling(vector<vector<int>>& trips, int capacity) {
    int stops[1001] = {};

    // 1. Same marking as Python
    for (auto t : trips) {
        stops[t[1]] += t[0];   // pick up
        stops[t[2]] -= t[0];   // drop off
    }

    // 2. Instead of tracking max, decrement capacity along the way
    for (int i = 0; capacity >= 0 && i < 1001; ++i) {
        capacity -= stops[i];   // subtract the current net change
    }

    // 3. If capacity never went <0, it's valid
    return capacity >= 0;
}
```

### Trick

* Instead of computing prefix sum explicitly (`x[i]+=x[i-1]`),
  it "burns" capacity directly:

  * picking up passengers ‚Üí reduce available capacity
  * dropping off passengers ‚Üí restore capacity
* If capacity ever goes negative, trip is impossible.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison

| Aspect          | Python approach                          | C++ approach                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Tracking method | Prefix sum + max passengers              | Directly deducts from capacity     |
| Final check     | `maxp <= capacity`                       | `capacity >= 0`                    |
| Readability     | Easier to see passenger count evolution  | More compact (avoids extra `maxp`) |
| Efficiency      | Both are O(N + K), where N=trips, K=1001 | Essentially the same complexity    |

---

üëâ So, **both are identical in logic**, just framed differently:

* Python computes **current load** at each stop.
* C++ computes **remaining capacity** at each stop.
