## What changed
- Added article: `programming/articles/scala-2-13-traits-implicits.html` covering Scala 2.13 traits, linearization, use cases, implicits (params/conversions/implicit classes), resolution order, and composition patterns, with navigation guidance.
- Added quiz: `programming/data/json/scala/scala-2-13-traits-implicits-questions.json` focusing on linearization, super disambiguation, implicit features, resolution scopes, context bound sugar, and patterns.
- Registered in `surveys.json` with id `scala-2-13-traits-implicits`.

## Notes
- The article avoids Scala 3 syntax and sticks to Scala 2.13 idioms.
- If needed, we can expand the article into a longer multi-part deep dive per request.
