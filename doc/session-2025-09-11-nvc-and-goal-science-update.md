# Session Notes â€” Remove Code, Add NVC & Goal Science

Date: 2025-09-11

## What changed
- Updated article `programming/articles/habits-behavior-communication.html`:
  - Removed programming code sections and Python examples per request.
  - Added a dedicated section on Nonviolent Communication (NVC) and empathy with scripts and guidance.
  - Added a new section on science-backed goal achievement (WOOP, mental contrasting, precommitment, temptation bundling, fresh start, planning fallacy antidotes).
  - Adjusted the table of contents and renumbered sections.
- Expanded quiz `programming/data/json/self-improvement/habits-behavior-words-questions.json` with 6 new questions on NVC and goal science.

## Notes
- Left the Anki CSV as-is (no programming code included) and still aligned with article themes.
- Did not modify other articles to avoid unintended scope; only this topic was changed.

## Next ideas
- Optionally add a small NVC quick-reference card image to the article.
- Consider adding new Anki cards for WOOP and empathic phrasing examples.
