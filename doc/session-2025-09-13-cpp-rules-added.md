# Session Notes — Add C++ Rules (Zero/Three/Five) + Clarify “Seven”

Date: 2025-09-13

## Changes
- Updated `programming/articles/cpp/memory-ownership-raii.html` with a dedicated section and table for:
  - Rule of Zero, Rule of Three, Rule of Five, and a clarification note about the informal/rare “Rule of Seven”.
- Updated the overview article `programming/articles/cpp-value-lifetimes-ownership-templates-concurrency.html` with a concise “Rules Cheat‑Sheet”.

## Notes
- “Rule of Seven” is not a standard C++ guideline; retained as a clarification so readers focus on the widely accepted Zero/Three/Five.
