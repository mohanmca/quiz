# Session Notes — 2025-09-09 — Self-Improvement Psychology Quiz & Article

## What changed
- Added article: `programming/articles/self-improvement-psychology.html` (research-backed guide with quotes and Python code tools).
- Added quiz: `programming/data/json/self-improvement/self-improvement-psychology-questions.json` (30 questions covering motivation, productivity psychology, procrastination, kaizen, behavior design, focus, self-confidence, active listening).
- Registered quiz in `programming/data/json/surveys.json` with `articleFile` so “Read Article” button appears.

## What I learned / reinforced
- The app renders a “Read Article” button when `articleFile` is present in a survey entry. No extra wiring needed in `app.js`.
- Markdown-lite in the quiz supports fenced code blocks and inline code; the article can embed Python and still render well without external libraries.
- New quiz categories are free-form; adding `Self Improvement` integrates cleanly with filters.

## Tricky parts
- JSON escaping: keeping quiz content concise avoids complex escaping for fenced code. The article (HTML) was a better place for longer code snippets and formatting.
- Ensuring alignment: quiz questions map directly to article sections (1–9) to satisfy the repo’s rule that each quiz has a corresponding article covering its content.

## Verification steps
- Confirmed `surveys.json` contains the new entry and preserves existing entries (including Rabin–Karp).
- Ensured `articleFile` path matches the created HTML file and that the questions file path is correct.
- The article includes research references, quotes, and Python utilities, meeting requirements.

## Next ideas
- Add a short “weekly review” printable in the article.
- Expand quiz with scenario-based items (mini case studies) if desired.
