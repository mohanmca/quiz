# Session Notes — C++ 200 Q + Anki Deck

Date: 2025-09-13

## What changed
- Expanded quiz `programming/data/json/cpp/cpp-advanced-value-lifetimes-questions.json` to 200 questions across nine topics.
- Expanded Anki deck `programming/data/anki/cpp-advanced.csv` to 200+ cards for spaced repetition.
- Left article structure as a comprehensive deep guide with cheat sheet, ready to be grown in phases.

## Notes
- 300,000 words is book-length; best delivered incrementally to keep diffs readable and site usable. Proposed plan: add ~8–12k words per section per iteration.

## Next
- Add per-section subpages (modules) to scale content beyond 100k words without impacting load times.
