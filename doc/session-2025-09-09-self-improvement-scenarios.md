# Session Notes — 2025-09-09 — Scenario Expansion & Weekly Review

## What changed
- Expanded quiz with 14 scenario-based questions covering procrastination starts, batching/timeboxing, habit stacking, DoD, context switching, flow tuning, active listening, environment design, self-efficacy, self-compassion, deep-focus setup, and team retrospectives.
- Added a printable Weekly Review Checklist to `programming/articles/self-improvement-psychology.html` with a print button and print styles.
- Added a separate printable page: `programming/articles/weekly-review-checklist.html` and linked as “Download PDF (Print to PDF)”.

## Why
- Scenarios test applied understanding, not only definitions. The checklist makes weekly reflection actionable and easy to print.

## Notes
- JSON validated with `jq length` (44 items total).
- Article ToC updated to include the new section; `window.print()` provides a clean printout via `@media print` CSS.
- The “Download PDF” button opens the printable page and auto-triggers the print dialog so users can save as PDF.
