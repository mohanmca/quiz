# Session Notes â€” 2025-09-30 Obstacles Article

## What I learned
- The index page populates the Articles panel strictly from `programming/data/json/articles.json`, so wiring a new page only needs that list updated.

## What was tricky
- Confirming whether a quiz entry already referenced the new obstacles article took a bit of repo spelunking; no existing survey mapped to it yet.
