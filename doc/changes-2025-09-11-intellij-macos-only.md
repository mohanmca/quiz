# Session Notes — Remove Windows Shortcuts from IntelliJ Navigation

Date: 2025-09-11

What changed
- Updated the IntelliJ navigation quiz and article to remove all Windows/Win-Linux shortcut references, retaining only macOS mappings.
- Affected files:
  - `programming/data/json/tools/intellij-navigation-questions.json`
  - `programming/articles/intellij-navigation-productivity.html`
  - `programming/articles/intellij-navigation-cheatsheet.html` (now macOS-only)
  - `programming/articles/intellij-navigation-cheatsheet-legacy.html` (preserved legacy with Windows/macOS)

Why
- Requested to present macOS-only shortcuts for the "intellij-navigation-productivity" topic across both quiz and article.

Details
- Quiz JSON: normalized option texts to macOS-only (e.g., "Cmd+Alt+B"), removed mixed "macOS / Win-Linux" phrasing, and adjusted correct answers accordingly.
- Article: removed Windows mentions in narrative bullets; simplified OS-agnostic hints; updated the keymap table to a macOS-only column.
 - Cheatsheet: main cheatsheet is macOS-only with a link to a legacy two-column (Windows/macOS) version.

Tricky bits
- Some shortcuts were labeled "(both)" or mixed (e.g., `Cmd/Ctrl`). Where present, chose the macOS variant (e.g., `Ctrl+Alt+H` kept as-is for mac as per existing article usage; `Cmd+Alt+B` for implementations).
- VCS popup varies by keymap; left the macOS example (`Ctrl+V`) and clarified it’s keymap dependent.

Validation
- Verified references via quick grep and manual inspection of the updated files.

Follow-ups (optional)
- If desired, mirror these macOS-only changes in `programming/articles/intellij-navigation-cheatsheet.html` for consistency.
