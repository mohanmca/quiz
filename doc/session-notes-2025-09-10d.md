# Session Notes — 2025-09-10 (PG16+ additions)

- Reviewed links (HN items, PGCon index internals) with approval and extracted relevant, version-safe takeaways for PostgreSQL 16+.
- Article update:
  - Added a "PostgreSQL 16+ Notes" subsection: pg_stat_io (PG16), partial indexes for sparse columns, REINDEX CONCURRENTLY for bloat, index advisor validation, and internals references.
- Quiz update:
  - Added psql_q61–psql_q68 covering pg_stat_io, partial indexes, REINDEX CONCURRENTLY, bloat assessment, B-Tree page splits/HOT updates, internals READMEs, and how pg_stat_io aids tuning.
- Validation: JSON parses (68 items total). Surveys unchanged except earlier timing bump.
