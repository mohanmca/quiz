# Session Notes — C++ Advanced Iterations (1–3)

Date: 2025-09-13

## Iteration 1 — Split into Deep-Dive Subpages
- Added dedicated deep-dive pages to scale content cleanly:
  - `programming/articles/cpp/value-categories-lifetimes.html`
  - `programming/articles/cpp/memory-ownership-raii.html`
  - `programming/articles/cpp/templates-generics.html`
- Updated the overview article’s TOC with “Deep Dive” links.

## Iteration 2 — Expand Value & Ownership Content
- Expanded value categories & lifetimes page with tables, binding/collapsing rules, materialization, lifetime extension, and diagnostics.
- Added ownership page with RAII rules, cycles/aliasing, custom deleters, and diagnostics.

## Iteration 3 — Templates & Generics Overview
- Added a focused templates page: specialization rules, SFINAE/detection idiom, Concepts/constraints, variadics/folds, dependent names, CRTP/constexpr meta.

## Rationale
- Breaking content into subpages keeps the site fast and maintainable while allowing future growth toward book-length coverage.

## Next (optional)
- Add deep-dive pages for Concurrency and Object Model, with memory-model diagrams and vtable layout notes.
