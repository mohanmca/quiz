**Prompt:**

Create a **LeetCode Medium Problems quiz** with the following requirements:

1. **Question Format**

   * Each question should have **four multiple-choice options**:

     * **One correct answer** containing a **Python code solution**.
     * **Three incorrect options** labeled as `"NA1"`, `"NA2"`, and `"NA3"`.
   * The **correct answer** must be **properly formatted** and displayed using **HTML `<pre>` tags** instead of markdown code blocks, for compatibility with SurveyJS (which does not render markdown).

2. **Problem Selection**

   * All problems must be **LeetCode Medium difficulty**.
   * Cover exactly **8 different algorithmic patterns**:

     * Stack
     * Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
     * Prefix Sum
     * Sliding Window
     * Heap (Priority Queue)
     * Tree
     * (Two more patterns of your choice, but still medium difficulty).

3. **Code Requirements**

   * The Python solutions should be **fully working and correct**.
   * Code must be **clean, readable, and indented properly**.
   * Use `<pre>` HTML tags for the code instead of \`\`\`python markdown fences.

4. **Output Formatting**

   * The quiz should be **completely recreated** in a single output (no piecemeal edits).
   * Each question must clearly display:

     * The **problem statement**.
     * The **four answer options** (only one correct, the rest NA1/NA2/NA3).
     * The Python solution in **HTML `<pre>` tags** for proper rendering.
